# Cloud Days Automation

## Contents of the repo

- mail_automation: Typescript code to transpile and upload to a container (Google Spreadsheet) that needs to have a specific structure
- main_automation: Typescript backend logic for App Maker. Once the code is transpiled, the code has to be copied over to App Maker by hang because unlike with Apps Script, there's no API to do so programmatically.
